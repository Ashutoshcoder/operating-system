# STRATEGIC PLAN

1.	What do we do?

    We as a business work upon the improvement of operating system, services and applications which would in turn improve customer satisfaction and business revenue.

2.	For whom do we do?

    We are focusing on ubuntu and that too for commodity users because ubuntu has large scale of beginners and also advanced developers working on various tools provided by the platform.

3.	How do we excel?

    After research and comparisons of various applications and domains, we found out that utilization of ubuntu is more. We also found out that during a single instance of an operating system, we can eliminate the timeout for startup. We realized that moving to a non-graphical environment at the time of startup is a much better approach for reduction of startup time. We found that for multiple applications such as browsers, network connectivity, updates all this require network administration which can be delayed or eliminated at the time of startup which by default improves(reduces) the startup time as the number of services during start up is reduced. Instead of running a single task at the start up time which would lead to delay, we can have multiple tasks running parallelly (at the same time).

**Typical Issues and questions to be considered during strategic assessment.**

*<ins>Issue-1 Objectives:</ins>* Managing the services that help in startup of the system, as we are looking into start up customers.

*<ins>Issue-2 is plan:</ins>* Customer collaboration is important. We are taking care of this through feedback provided by the users.

*<ins>Issue-3 Organizational Structure:</ins>* Movement towards a new version of the operating system which will require adaptability, training of the respective system users. Constant evaluation of adaptability of employees(because services being closed down to be started be employees now). 

*<ins>Issue-4 MIS:</ins>* System can provide information about lacking areas through feedback. Through feedback areas of improvement can be known.

*<ins>Issue-5 Personnel:</ins>* System can improve communication skill through feedback, quick problem solving, developing team can contribute more.

*<ins>Issue-6 Image:</ins>* Customer satisfaction through regular feedback and solution. Customer can always collaborate as feedback will always be asked.
