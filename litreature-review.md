## Literature Review  

When electronic computers where first introduced in the 1940's they were created without any operating systems.
All programming language was done is absolute machine language and is generally used for making simple math operation.
The first operating system was introduced in the early 1950's, it was called GMOS and was created by General Motors for IBM's machine the 701.
Operating systems in the 1950's were called single-stream batch processing systems because the data was submitted in groups.
By the late 1960's operating systems designers were able to develop the system of multiprogramming in which a computer program will be able to perform multiple jobs at the same time.
The fourth generation of operating systems saw the creation of personal computing.
Although these computers were very similar to the minicomputers developed in the third generation,
personal computers cost a very small fraction of what minicomputers cost although a personal computer was so affordable that it made it possible for a single individual could be able to own one for personal
use while minicomputers where still at such a high price that only corporations could afford to have them.

One of the major factors in the creation of personal computing was the birth of Microsoft and
the Windows operating system. The windows Operating System was created in 1975 when Paul Allen
and Bill Gates had a vision to take personal computing to the next level.
They introduced the MS-DOS in 1981 although it was effective it created much difficulty
for people who tried to understand its cryptic commands.
Windows went on to become the largest operating system used in technology today with
releases of Windows 95, Windows 98, WIndows XP (Which is currently the most used operating system to
this day), and their newest operating system Windows 7.

Along with Microsoft, Apple is the other major operating system created in the 1980's.
Steve Jobs, co- founder of Apple, created the Apple Macintosh which was a huge success due to the fact that it was so user friendly.

Windows development throughout the later years were influenced by the Macintosh and it created a strong competition between the two companies.
Today all of our electronic devices run off of operating systems,
from our computers and smartphones , to ATM machines and motor vehicles.
And as technology advances, so do operating systems.
