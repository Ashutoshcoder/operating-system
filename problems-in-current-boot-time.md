# Problems in existing system related to boot time:

 > More peripherals prompt slow PC Boot Times
Each new version includes more features and requires more storage. Storage and memory manufacturers create products that meet the needs, but this was at the cost of slow PC boot time. More physical drivers meant more system checks on those drivers at boot. This started using a lot of memory resulting in the increase in boot time.
Todayâ€™s desktop PCs and laptops provide 3 or 4 ports as handy as they are, they breed drivers slow down the boot time. [19]

> Slow dual boot
Many users tend to run multiple operating systems on their PC. However, dual boot can sometimes cause your boot sequence to slow down resulting increase in boot time. [20]

> Remove some startup programs : If you experience slowness between logging in and actually getting to use your computer, too many startup programs could be the culprit.A lot of software sets itself to automatically run at startup. If dozens of apps are loading as soon as you log in, this can really bog your system down right away increasing in the boot time. [21]

> Boot Freeze
While booting, the system gets stuck and there is only the logo displayed.

>Updates -Upgraded Ubuntu 18.04 suddenly boots slowly.
Missing OS address space
When system abruptly shuts down so it affects the processes which can also affect the boot files (i.e it abruptly writes into the memory which can lead to missing address space)
