# PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

As a customer to our operating system business, one would expect improved product after certain intervals in certain areas. As of now, we are working to improve the startup time which in turn will improve customer’s business model by helping their machines to startup fast and improve their business. Many of the operating system compared to our business, start unnecessary services during the startup which can be enabled whenever it is required for the particular task. (As per customer’s ease of usage we can suggest as many services to be eliminated which are of less priority during startup). Adaptability to change is appreciated in our development cycle, along with constant review and close monitoring (as long as it does not affect the system architecture).
