# TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT

* Hardware compatibility: Linux distribution has limited number of drivers for different types of hardware, so some of the hardware doesn't support the Operating System.
* 70% to 80% of boot time processes are critical, so we cannot change those processes.
* We cannot change the boot sequence, because some of the process depends on each other.
