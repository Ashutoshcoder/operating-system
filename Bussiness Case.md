# BUSINESS CASE

**1. How to improve the quality of software development through a business case?**

Our main and major objective is to improvise the boot time of the operating system, considering the current scenario we have selected ubuntu as our target OS. -Since large user base from beginner to experienced programmers refer to ubuntu as their prime operating system for their development and since we are targeting the boot time, it will have a certain effect on applications during startup, e.g. network administration which is not required at the time of startup.

By reducing the boot time, we not only improve the profits of the business but also help with the cloud and virtualization because there the booting time is a major factor.
We are testing each service which is not required at boot time and trying to eliminate it for improvising the quality of software development also acceptance of User Feedback for each service.
 
**2. How to improve the quality of software development through service level management?**

We are dividing our deliverables into various phases to have a phase wise deliverable. Delay for each phase will have buffer in the number of days example; 5 days, which can also result in project delay. Regular feedback from users after each usage week. System reports after each phase. Bug/Error report if received should be reported immediately.

Pros:
* Improvement in customer satisfaction due to reduction in boot time.
* Phase wise development helps to get the customer feedback at each phase which helps us in improving our product.
* As we have phase wise development so we can tackle the bugs/errors at very early stages and also because of this we do not have to face any major bug in the final development.

Cons:
* As this is a phase wise development so whenever any phase is delayed this results in the delay of the project as a whole.
* If two versions are dependent on each other, it can't be released independently.

**3. How to improve the quality of software development through systematic testing?**

*Various Testing:*
Checking of services before and after boot time reduction. i.e. Services started at boot; Services which are not mandatory. 
* Checking for user response and feedback based on the current changes in software. 
* Crash and stress testing for determination of large-scale usage. 
* Also, unit testing as it a phase wise development so the customer gets to test the product phase wise and provide their feedback for improvement. 
* Integration testing after unit testing.

**4. How to improve the quality of software development through systematic problem management.**

Problem management in detail:
* There was a problem in understanding different operating systems according to their objectives and filtering out operating system according to customer base was our priority.
* We selected ubuntu as our prime research operating system as it has large commodity user and also preferred in cloud architecture compared to centos.
* We have determined the processes/services which are part of bootup processes and we have understood what all are essentially required processes and what all can be omitted.
* Thus, helping in improvement of business product with the elimination of unnecessary elements. Also, larger processes can be split and can be executed concurrently.
* As it a phase wise development so there are chances of the version not working, so we can have a rollback to previous version.

## What is business case?
*Problem:* Boot time reduction for commodity users.

*Solutions:* large user base, good support, how daily users are affected? Supports container as well as cloud.

*Approach:* methodologies/product upgrade.

*Risk assessment:* low popularity, market competitor, prevention of change, goodwill loss

*Value:* large market cover, increase in goodwill

## Why businnes case is needed?
Business process-based approaches are helpful in identifying business requirements as the knowledge is captured at a more abstract. Business case is needed to have a business outlook of technical approach. It helps in defining scope of product or/and the project. It helps in reducing costs with increase benefits.

## When is it established?
It is established before requirements specification and also before development.

## Who are the potential users of the business case?
Business case might be used by the project manager, business decision maker, business analyst, IT service managers, s/w designer, product managers, all the stakeholders except the client.
